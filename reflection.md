- What are your initial impressions of how `Association` affects your programming?
I'm not sure I did anything differently than how I normally would. Other than marking the engine as final (which makes sense), I don't think I thought actively about association. It makes sense that there are some classes that are part of others and some that just interact with others but I didn't do anything differently.
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
It worked to go in order of the steps, debug as I went, engage in productive struggle, and then go to office hours to make sure I fully understood what I was doing.
